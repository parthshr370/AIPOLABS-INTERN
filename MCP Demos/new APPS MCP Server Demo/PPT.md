# CAMEL AI + ACI.dev: Supercharging HR with AI Agents & 600+ MCP Tools
*A Technical Deep Dive for Tahakom*

---

## Slide 1: Title & Vision

# 🐫 CAMEL AI + ACI.dev
## Transforming HR with Autonomous AI Agents

**Today's Mission**: Show you how to build AI agents that don't just chat—they *actually get work done*

**What We'll Cover**:
- Why traditional AI tooling is broken
- How MCP + ACI.dev fixes everything
- Live code walkthrough of our HR Agent
- Real-world HR automation in action

**Built for Tahakom**: Practical, production-ready AI automation

---

## Slide 2: The Problem - LLMs Are Just Fancy Word Machines

# 🤖 The Reality Check

**LLMs Today**:
- Great at writing essays ✅
- Sparking creative ideas ✅
- Breaking down concepts ✅
- But connecting to real work? ❌

**The Truth**: *Without tooling, they're just fancy word machines*

**What We Actually Need**:
- Pull fresh data from Gmail
- Update spreadsheets automatically
- Schedule calendar meetings
- Send professional emails
- Manage databases seamlessly

**The Gap**: How do we bridge LLMs to real business tools?

---

## Slide 3: Traditional Tooling - The Walled Garden Problem

# 🔧 Traditional Tooling Headaches

**What Tooling Should Do**:
Give your AI a set of directions to kick off specific actions when you ask

**The Walled Garden Problem**:
- OpenAI has their tools 🏠
- Cursor has their tools 🏠
- Anthropic has their tools 🏠
- Everyone else has their tools 🏠

**Result**:
- No interoperability
- Vendor lock-in nightmares
- Developers rebuilding everything
- Enterprise headaches

**Example**: Want Gmail + Sheets + Calendar? Build 3 separate integrations!

---

## Slide 4: MCP - The Universal Connector

# 🌐 MCP: The Better Tooling

**MCP** = Model Context Protocol
*Think of it as the universal adapter for AI tools*

**How It Works**:
- **Client** (your AI agent) talks to **Server** (where tools live)
- Need latest emails? Ping MCP server → Get Gmail data → Return results
- Need to schedule meeting? Ping MCP server → Access Calendar → Book slot

**MCP Architecture**:
```
AI Agent → MCP Server → Gmail/Sheets/Calendar/Notion
         ↑
    Single Protocol
```

**But Standard MCP Has Issues**:
- One server per app (messy!)
- Manual OAuth setup (painful!)
- No smart tool selection (dumb!)

---

## Slide 5: ACI.dev - MCP Done Right

# 🚀 ACI.dev: MCP Supercharged

**How ACI.dev Fixes MCP**:

**❌ Standard MCP**: One server, one app
**✅ ACI.dev**: All apps, one server

**❌ Standard MCP**: Manual OAuth hell
**✅ ACI.dev**: Centralized auth hub

**❌ Standard MCP**: Predefined tools only
**✅ ACI.dev**: Smart tool discovery

**❌ Standard MCP**: Context overload
**✅ ACI.dev**: Lean, on-demand loading

**The Magic**: 600+ tools through single MCP connection

**Apps Available**: Gmail, Sheets, Calendar, Notion, Slack, GitHub, Jira, Salesforce... and 590+ more!

                                                └─────────────────┘
```

**Flow**: User Request → Agent Plans → MCP Executes → Results Delivered

**Key Components**:
- `create_config.py`: Dynamic MCP configuration
- `simple.py`: Autonomous HR agent
- `.env`: Secure credential management

---

## Slide 8: Code Deep Dive - Configuration

# 🔧 Dynamic MCP Configuration

**The Magic**: `create_config.py` creates our tool connection

```python
def create_config():
    config = {
        "mcpServers": {
            "aci_apps": {
                "command": "uvx",
                "args": [
                    "aci-mcp",
                    "apps-server",
                    "--apps=GMAIL,GOOGLE_SHEETS,GOOGLE_CALENDAR,RESEND,NOTION",
                    "--linked-account-owner-id", linked_account_owner_id,
                ],
                "env": {"ACI_API_KEY": aci_api_key},
            }
        }
    }
```

**What's Happening**:
- Single server config for 5 business apps
- Dynamic credentials from environment
- One command unlocks all tools
- Clean, maintainable setup

---

## Slide 9: Code Deep Dive - Agent Initialization

# 🤖 Agent Creation & Connection

**Robust Connection with Retries**:
```python
# Connect with retries
max_retries = 3
retry_delay_seconds = 5
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        await mcp_toolkit.connect()
        console.log("✓ Services Connected.")
        break
    except MCPConnectionError as e:
        if attempt < max_retries - 1:
            await asyncio.sleep(retry_delay_seconds)
        else:
            raise e
```

**Production-Ready Features**:
- Automatic retry logic
- Graceful error handling
- Rich console feedback
- Clean failure modes

---

## Slide 10: Code Deep Dive - Agent Persona

# 🎭 The Autonomous Agent Persona

**Smart Agent Behavior**:
```python
hr_assistant_prompt = """You are a helpful, proactive, and autonomous HR Assistant.

**Your Core Workflow:**
1. **Deconstruct the Goal:** Break down tasks internally. Do NOT output this plan.
2. **Attempt to Find Information First:** Use tools before asking users.
3. **Execute Sequentially:** One step at a time, using output as input.
4. **Summarize, Don't Narrate:** Stay silent until task complete.
5. **Provide a Final Report:** Single comprehensive summary.

**Your Tools:** Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Sheets, Resend, Notion."""
```

**Key Principles**:
- Autonomous planning (no hand-holding)
- Proactive information gathering
- Silent execution (no play-by-play)
- Comprehensive final reporting

---

## Slide 11: Code Deep Dive - Agent Setup

# ⚙️ Model & Agent Configuration

**Gemini 2.5 Pro Configuration**:
```python
model = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.GEMINI,
    model_type="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06",
    api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"),
    model_config_dict={"temperature": 0.2, "max_tokens": 8000},
)

tools = mcp_toolkit.get_tools()
agent = ChatAgent(
    model=model,
    system_message=hr_assistant_prompt,
    tools=tools,
    memory=None
)
```

**Technical Specs**:
- Latest Gemini model (cutting-edge performance)
- Low temperature (0.2) for focused responses
- 8K token context for complex tasks
- All ACI tools automatically available

---

## Slide 12: Code Deep Dive - Interactive Loop

# 🔄 The Conversation Engine

**Clean Interactive Experience**:
```python
while True:
    user_input = console.input("You: ").strip()

    if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit", "bye"]:
        break

    user_message = BaseMessage.make_user_message(
        role_name="User", content=user_input
    )

    with console.status("Agent is working..."):
        response = await agent.astep(user_message)

    for msg in response.msgs:
        rprint(f"HR Assistant: {msg.content}")
```

**UX Features**:
- Rich console interface
- Working status indicators
- Clean exit commands
- Async processing for responsiveness

---

## Slide 13: Live Demo - HR Workflows

# 🎬 HR Agent in Action

**Scenario 1: Email Management**
```
User: "fetch the latest mail in my inbox"
Agent: → Searches Gmail → Extracts key info → Summarizes results
Result: "Latest email: Job Application from candidate@company.com"
```

**Scenario 2: Interview Scheduling**
```
User: "schedule interview with John for next Tuesday 2 PM"
Agent: → Checks calendar → Creates meeting → Sends invite
Result: "Interview scheduled and invite sent!"
```

**Scenario 3: Candidate Tracking**
```
User: "add this candidate to our hiring spreadsheet"
Agent: → Opens Google Sheets → Adds new row → Updates status
Result: "Candidate added to tracking sheet with status 'Interview Scheduled'"
```

**The Magic**: One agent, multiple apps, seamless workflow
