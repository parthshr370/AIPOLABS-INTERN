# ACI.dev Unified MCP Server Upgrade

## Summary of Changes

This project has been upgraded from using ACI.dev's **Apps MCP Server** to the **Unified MCP Server** for enhanced dynamic function discovery and access to all 600+ tools on the ACI.dev platform.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Backend Configuration (`create_config.py`)

**Before (Apps MCP Server):**
```python
"command": "aci-mcp",
"args": [
    "apps-server",
    "--apps=MEM0,BRAVE_SEARCH,GMAIL",  # Limited to specific apps
    "--linked-account-owner-id", "your_user_id"
]
```

**After (Unified MCP Server):**
```python
"command": "aci-mcp", 
"args": [
    "unified-server",                    # Dynamic server
    "--linked-account-owner-id", "your_user_id",
    "--allowed-apps-only"              # Only allowed apps, but all functions
]
```

### 2. Agent System Message (`memory_agent.py`)

**Enhanced with:**
- Instructions for using `ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS` and `ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION` meta-functions
- Dynamic function discovery workflow
- Intent-based tool searching guidance
- Recommended prompt structure from ACI.dev documentation

### 3. Frontend Updates

**Chat Component:**
- Updated initial agent message to mention Unified MCP Server and 600+ tools
- Enhanced capabilities description

**ProjectInfo Component:**
- Added new sample prompts showcasing cross-app workflows
- Updated description to mention dynamic function discovery
- Added "Web Search + Memory" and "Dynamic Tool Discovery" capabilities

### 4. Configuration File (`config.json`)

**Updated server name:** `aci_apps` â†’ `aci_unified`
**Server command:** `apps-server` â†’ `unified-server`
**Arguments:** Removed specific app list, added `--allowed-apps-only`

## Benefits of Unified MCP Server

### ðŸš€ **Enhanced Capabilities**
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Agent can discover and use any of 600+ tools on-demand
- **Context Optimization**: Only loads needed functions, reducing context window usage
- **Future-Proof**: Automatically gains access to new tools added to ACI.dev platform
- **Cross-App Workflows**: Seamlessly combine multiple tools in single operations

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Advantages**
- **2 Meta-Functions** instead of dozens of specific functions
- **Intent-Based Search** for more intelligent tool selection
- **Reduced Configuration** - no need to pre-specify app lists
- **Better Performance** - smaller context window with dynamic loading

### ðŸ’¡ **User Experience**
- **More Flexible Queries**: Users can ask for complex multi-app operations
- **Intelligent Tool Selection**: Agent finds the best tools for each task
- **Expanded Capabilities**: Access to entire ACI.dev ecosystem

## Usage Examples

### Memory + Web Search
```
"Search for the latest news about AI agents and store the key findings in my memory for future reference."
```

### Dynamic Email + Memory
```
"I need to send an email about my travel memories to a friend. Find the right tools and help me compose and send it."
```

### Cross-App Operations  
```
"Find my stored work experience, search for similar job opportunities online, and save the promising ones to my memories."
```

## Technical Architecture

```
User Request â†’ Agent Analyzes Intent â†’ ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS â†’ Relevant Tools Found â†’ ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION â†’ Results â†’ Natural Response
```

## Migration Complete âœ…

The project now leverages the full power of ACI.dev's Unified MCP Server while maintaining all existing functionality and adding significant new capabilities for dynamic, intelligent tool discovery and execution.

## Next Steps

1. Test the upgraded system with various query types
2. Explore the expanded tool capabilities
3. Leverage cross-app workflows for enhanced user experiences
4. Monitor performance improvements from reduced context usage
