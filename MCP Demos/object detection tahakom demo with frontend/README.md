## üéØ Demo Script

Perfect for conferences and presentations:

### Live Demo Flow
1. **Show email** with invoice attachment
2. **Run agent** with command: "Process the invoice from ABC Corp"
3. **Watch automation**:
   - Email detection ‚úì
   - Data extraction ‚úì
   - Spreadsheet update ‚úì
   - Calendar reminder ‚úì
   - Confirmation email ‚úì
4. **Show results** in all connected systems
5. **Generate report** to show tracking capabilities

### Conference Talking Points
- **Problem**: Manual invoice processing takes 15+ minutes per invoice
- **Solution**: AI agent reduces this to 30 seconds with perfect accuracy
- **Integration**: Seamlessly connects 5 business tools
- **Scalability**: Same pattern works for any document workflow
- **ROI**: 95% time savings, 100% accuracy, complete audit trail

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent won't start:**
- Check API keys in `.env` file
- Verify ACI.dev account has required app permissions
- Ensure Google services are properly connected

**Email not detected:**
- Check Gmail search permissions
- Verify invoice emails aren't in spam
- Confirm sender/subject line patterns

**File upload fails:**
- Check Google Drive permissions
- Verify folder structure exists
- Ensure sufficient storage space

**Calendar reminder not created:**
- Check Google Calendar permissions
- Verify date format in invoice

### Debug Mode
Run with verbose output:
```bash
python invoice_agent.py --debug
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Workflows
Modify `invoice_agent.py` to add custom processing steps:

```python
async def custom_workflow(self, user_input: str):
    """Add your custom invoice processing logic"""
    # Your custom implementation here
    pass
```

### Extending Data Fields
