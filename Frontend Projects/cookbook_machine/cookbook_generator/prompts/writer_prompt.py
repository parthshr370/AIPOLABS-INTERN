- `example_usage`: Style your code examples as specified.
- `writer_instructions`: These are direct orders you must follow.

**Your Process:**
1. Analyze the `StyleGuide` to understand the required style.
2. Write content for the given section goal.
3. Ensure every sentence and format choice complies with the `StyleGuide`.
