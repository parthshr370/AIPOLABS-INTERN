## 🎨 **Post-Migration Enhancement: Style Designer Agent**

To further enhance the cookbook generation process, a new agent has been added to the pipeline, enabling dynamic styling and intent.

### **New Agent: The Style Designer**
A new **Style Designer Agent** has been introduced as the first step in the generation pipeline.

- **Function**: It analyzes an example cookbook or document provided by the user.
- **Output**: It generates a comprehensive JSON object (`IntentStyle`) that defines the target cookbook's tone, voice, structure, and formatting.
- **Impact**: This `IntentStyle` object is then passed to all subsequent agents (Planner, Writer, and Assembler), ensuring a consistent and user-defined style throughout the final output.

### **Updated Workflow**
The agent workflow is now:
1.  **🎨 Style Designer** → Defines the style from an example.
2.  **🧠 Planner Agent** → Creates the plan, adhering to the style.
3.  **✍️  Writer Agent** → Writes content, following the style.
4.  **📑 Assembler Agent** → Assembles the final document, ensuring style consistency.

This enhancement moves the system from a fixed-style generator to a more flexible platform capable of adapting to various documentation styles on the fly.
