## Input/Output Processing Details

### 1. Query Intelligence Processing
**Input**: `"What are my most effective pain management approaches?"`
**Processing Steps**:
- Extract medical concepts: pain, management, effectiveness
- Identify question type: treatment_effectiveness_analysis
- Determine scope: across_all_patients
- Set analysis depth: comprehensive

**Output**:
```json
{
  "concepts": ["pain_management", "treatment_effectiveness", "patient_outcomes"],
  "question_type": "clinical_effectiveness_analysis",
  "scope": "all_pain_patients",
  "success_criteria": "identify_most_successful_protocols"
}
```

### 2. Memory Search Processing
**Input**: Research plan with search queries
**Processing Steps**:
- Execute mem0.search() with medical concept filters
- Apply temporal filters for time-based analysis
- Filter by user_id patterns (doctor_memory, patient_*)
- Preserve clinical context and metadata

**Output**:
```json
{
  "pain_management_memories": [
    {"patient": "Anjali Kwon", "treatment": "Tramadol 50mg", "outcome": "effective"},
    {"patient": "Patient_16565", "treatment": "combination therapy", "outcome": "improved"}
