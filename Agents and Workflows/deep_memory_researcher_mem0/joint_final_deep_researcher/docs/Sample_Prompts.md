# Deep Memory Research Sample Prompts

**Focused research questions designed for medical memory databases.** These prompts leverage the 4-phase strategic research pipeline to uncover meaningful patterns, correlations, and insights from patient consultation memories.

Based on typical database structure: patient consultations with metadata including `patient_name`, `session_type`, `summary_fact`, and personal memories with hobby/lifestyle data.

## üë• **Patient Population Insights**

### **5. Family History Impact on Treatment Decisions**
*"How does documented family history influence my diagnostic workups and preventive care strategies, and which family history factors most strongly predict my clinical interventions?"*

**Strategic research required:** Must identify family history mentions across consultations, correlate with ordered tests/treatments, and identify decision-making patterns based on genetic risk factors.

### **6. Patient Name Origins and Health Patterns**
*"Are there cultural or ethnic patterns in disease prevalence or treatment responses among my patients based on name origins and associated lifestyle factors?"*

**Your example query!** Perfect for deep research - requires name analysis for ethnic inference, disease pattern identification, cultural lifestyle factor analysis, and correlation studies.

### **7. Socioeconomic Health Disparities**
*"What socioeconomic indicators appear in my patient consultations, and how do they correlate with medication adherence, follow-up compliance, and health outcomes?"*

**Multi-layer analysis:** Must identify socioeconomic clues in consultation notes, track adherence patterns, analyze follow-up behavior, and correlate with treatment success.

### **8. Gender-Based Treatment Variations**
*"How do my diagnostic and treatment approaches differ between male and female patients for the same conditions, and what gender-specific health patterns emerge?"*

**Comparative analysis:** Gender identification, condition-matching across genders, treatment comparison, and outcome pattern analysis.

## üíä **Clinical Decision Analysis**

### **9. Medication Side Effect Management Strategies**
*"What side effects do I most commonly encounter across different medication classes, and how have my management strategies for these effects evolved?"*

**Pattern recognition:** Side effect identification across medications, management strategy documentation, evolution tracking, and effectiveness assessment.

### **10. Diagnostic Workup Efficiency**
*"For patients presenting with similar symptoms, which diagnostic approaches lead to faster, more accurate diagnoses, and where do I see patterns of over- or under-testing?"*

**Process optimization:** Symptom clustering, diagnostic pathway analysis, time-to-diagnosis tracking, and testing efficiency evaluation.

### **11. Referral Decision Patterns**
*"What factors trigger my specialist referral decisions, and how do referral outcomes inform my threshold for future similar cases?"*

**Decision tree analysis:** Referral trigger identification, outcome tracking, threshold analysis, and decision-making evolution.

### **12. Preventive Care Implementation**
*"How effectively do I implement age-appropriate preventive care guidelines, and which patient factors influence preventive care compliance?"*

**Guideline adherence:** Age-based screening tracking, implementation rate analysis, patient factor correlation, and compliance pattern identification.

## üîç **Symptom and Complication Studies**

### **13. Early Warning Sign Recognition**
*"What subtle symptoms or patient behaviors in my notes have retrospectively predicted serious complications, and how can I better recognize these patterns?"*

**Predictive analysis:** Historical symptom analysis, complication correlation, pattern recognition, and early detection improvement strategies.

### **14. Chronic Pain Management Evolution**
*"How have my chronic pain management approaches evolved, and which multimodal strategies show the best patient-reported outcomes?"*

**Treatment evolution:** Pain management strategy tracking, outcome measurement, multimodal approach analysis, and effectiveness comparison.

### **15. Mental Health Integration**
*"How often do I document mental health concerns in medical consultations, and what patterns exist in the intersection of physical and mental health in my practice?"*

**Holistic care analysis:** Mental health documentation tracking, physical-mental health correlation, integrated care approach analysis.

---

## üè† **Lifestyle and Personal Factors**

### **16. Hobby-Health Connection Analysis**
*"Based on personal information in my patient records, how do different hobbies and lifestyle activities correlate with overall health outcomes and specific medical conditions?"*

**Lifestyle correlation:** Hobby identification from personal memories, health outcome correlation, activity-based risk assessment, and protective factor analysis.

### **17. Stress and Health Patterns**
*"What mentions of stress, work pressure, or life changes appear in my consultations, and how do these correlate with symptom severity and treatment response?"*
