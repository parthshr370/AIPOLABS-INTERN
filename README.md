## üîí Security & Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This repository has been cleaned of all sensitive information including:
- Real API keys and secrets (removed from all `.env` files)
- Build artifacts (`__pycache__`, `node_modules`, `.git` directories)
- Temporary and cache files

**Before running any project**:
1. Check each project's README for required API keys
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your actual keys
3. Never commit real secrets - use the provided `.gitignore`

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for detailed security guidelines.
